Please refer to Brainard et al publication (under review as of this writing, hopefully will be published in 2025), with title = "Did COVID-19 surveillance system sensitivity change after Omicron? A retrospective observational study in England".

The scripts are only useful with the appropriate datasets, none of which we can redistribute ourselves or they are only available upon application to the data custodians, as described in Brainard et al.
the scripts are written to be used in a "cut and paste" style, where only parts of the code need to be run, or some editing is done for sub-analyses as required.
